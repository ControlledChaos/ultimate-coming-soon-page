== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What mail service providers do you support? =

Currently we support FeedBurner. To activate email subscriptions for your feed.

1. Go to [FeedBurner.com](http://feedburner.com/ "FeedBurner") and login
1. Click **My Feeds** in the upper-left-hand corner
1. Select your feed from the list
1. Click the **Publicize** tab
1. Click **Email Subscriptions** on the left
1. Make sure **Feedburner** is selected, and click **Activate**

= Can I add a Countdown? =

OK, I'm going to say it. Countdowns are super lame. Sites never launch on time. I highly suggest not putting a countdown on your site. 
If you feel you must have one then use the custom html and javascript option to add in your countdown code.
